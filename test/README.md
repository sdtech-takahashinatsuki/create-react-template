# Test directory â€” Template CLI execution tests

This directory is used to test the template CLI (the local `create-react-template` generator) by running it end-to-end and then running the generated project's build and test steps.

The project includes convenience scripts in `package.json` that create temporary example projects, install dependencies, build them, and run their tests. Use `pnpm` (or `npm`/`npx` when noted) to run these scripts from this `test/` directory.

## Purpose

- Provide a place to verify the template generator works correctly across supported templates.
- Each script clears a previous test folder, runs the generator to create a new test project, installs dependencies, builds the generated project, and runs its test suite.

## Available scripts and usage

All commands below should be run from the `test/` directory (project root: `.../create-react-template/test`).

- Test Next.js (App Router) template

  ```bash
  pnpm run test:next-app
  ```

  What it does:
  - Remove any existing `next-app-test` folder.
  - Run the local generator entry point using `npx tsx` to create a new project named `next-app-test` with framework `next/app`.
  - Change into the newly created `next-app-test` directory, install dependencies using `pnpm`, build the generated project, and run its tests.

- Test Next.js (Pages Router) template

  ```bash
  pnpm run test:next-pages
  ```

  What it does:
  - Remove any existing `next-pages-test` folder.
  - Run the generator to create `next-pages-test` with framework `next/pages`.
  - Install dependencies, build, and run tests inside `next-pages-test`.

- Test TanStack Router template

  ```bash
  pnpm run test:tanstack
  ```

  What it does:
  - Remove any existing `tanstack-test` folder.
  - Run the generator to create `tanstack-test` with framework `tanstack-router`.
  - Install dependencies, build, and run tests inside `tanstack-test`.

## Notes and environment

- These scripts call `npx tsx ../src/create-template/index.ts` to execute the local generator. Make sure `tsx` is available (it will be downloaded by `npx` if necessary).
- The `test/` scripts expect `pnpm` to be installed globally (the repository uses pnpm). If you prefer `npm`, you can manually run the steps after the generator finishes.
- Running these scripts will download dependencies and may take several minutes depending on your network and machine.
- If you want to inspect the generated project without running `pnpm i` or tests, you can run the generator manually:

  ```bash
  npx tsx ../src/create-template/index.ts -n my-test-project -f next/app
  ```

  Then `cd my-test-project` and run whatever steps you prefer.

## Troubleshooting

- If a test fails during installation or build, check the generated project's `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` and confirm your Node.js and pnpm versions are compatible.
- Remove generated folders manually if the automated removal fails and try again.

Happy testing!
